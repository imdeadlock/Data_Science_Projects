Data Analysis of Zomato

Zomato has an average of 17.5 million monthly transacting customers for its food delivery business. Average monthly active food delivery restaurant partners on Zomatoâ€™s platform have also increased by 8.7% Y-o-Y, from 208,000 to 226,000. 

I have solved below questions on the dataset with the help of Python 
Questions:
1.What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2.How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3.What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4.Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
5.Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6.Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can customers with some good offers?
